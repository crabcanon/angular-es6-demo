# kiosked-assignment
 An experimental project in using ES6 via SystemJS, JSPM, Gulp, Babel and AngularJS.
 
## About

* A npm package originally designed for learning how to craft a complete webapp project from scratch(npm init & jspm init & gulp init).
* This package could be used to explore:
  * new features of ECMAScript 6.
  * how to use JSPM/SystemJS to maintain your project. 
  * how to construct and combine Gulp tasks.
  * how to code with AngularJS 1.x in using ES6.
  * how to provide a good structure of SASS.  
  
## Features

* No more `bower`
* No more `RequireJS`(replaced by `ES6 modules`)
* AngularJS 1.x embraces `ES6`
* Easy to install & run(`npm start`)
* Maintain dependencies by `jspm`
* Watch and reload webpage in real-time via `gulp watch serve`
* Bootstrap the webpage via `systemjs`

## TODO

- [x] Title: “Build test”
- [x] Paragraph: “This page was built from dynamic content at <time>”, where <time> is the time at build time.
- [x] Button name: 'Click me'.
- [x] The title, paragraph and button text should not be black, but should be the same colour.
- [x] The background of the button should also be the same colour, but 25% lighter.
- [x] A popup modal will be shown if click the button.
- [x] Counter counting up from 0 (at least show the seconds changing).
- [x] Close and reopen the modal.
- [ ] Content’s font-size should be dependant on the screen size.
- [x] Use a build tool (npm/grunt/gulp) to compose your built product.
- [x] Use SASS (scss).
- [ ] Show understanding of variables and functions (lighter colour).
- [ ] Show understanding of mixins (CSS media queries).
- [x] Push the code to Github as a public open source project.
- [x] Add a README to the Github repo containing information about building and running your code.
- [x] A “watcher” task that watches for code changes and builds again.
- [ ] Neatness and documentation.
- [x] Modern practices and technologies.
